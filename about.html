      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p><b>The Raleigh Concert Band</b> is a non-profit organization that provides adult musicians the opportunity to perform high-quality musical compositions in formal and informal concerts and events. The Band is a successor organization to several other amateur bands variously known as "Raleigh City Band," "Raleigh Municipal Band," and "Raleigh Concert Band," which operated from the middle of the twentieth century until around 1975.</p>
      <p>
        The current Organization, originally named “The Raleigh Community Band,” began rehearsals at a small building at Jaycee Park in September 1978, with partial sponsorship of the City of Raleigh Parks and Recreation Department.  From a beginning roster of about 30 musicians under the leadership of founding Director Dick Southwick.  Today the Band has over 70 volunteer brass, woodwind, and percussion players with the instrumentation (and ability) to play the full range of concert band literature.  During the early 1990’s, the Band’s Board of Directors voted to change the name to The Raleigh Concert Band.

        Our members come from a variety of backgrounds and professions, including teachers, doctors, engineers, computer specialists, and retirees.
